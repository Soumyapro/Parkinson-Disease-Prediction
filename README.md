## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

## Models

1. **Logistic Regression**: A basic linear model used for binary classification.
2. **XGBoost**: An ensemble method known for its performance and efficiency in classification tasks. It provided the best results for this project.
3. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A powerful classifier that works well for both linear and non-linear problems.

Among the models tested, **XGBoost** yielded the best results in terms of classification metrics.
